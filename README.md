# Simple MEAN App

This is a simple MEAN app I created to learn about the MEAN stack and deploying on Heroku. The app consists of a simple contact list where you can view all the contacts, add new contacts, update existing contains and delete existing contacts (CRUD operations). The app can be viewed [here](https://secure-bayou-52585.herokuapp.com/).

_Note: The mLab MongoDB add-on has been discontinued causing some poritions of the app the no longer work._
